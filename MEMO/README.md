# MEMO

MEmory MOdels (MEMO) contains the models used as the "memory" of the Learning AGent (LAG). The current data structures only account for Simple Black and White Images, but will contain more complex models later on.

### To Do

1. Confirm data output
2. Create a more confident way to determine "completness" of analysis in analyzeImage()
3. Look into ways to adjust model network to be more generalized and adaptable
