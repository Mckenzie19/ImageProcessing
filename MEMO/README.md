# MEMO

MEmory MOdels (MEMO) contains the models used as the "memory" of the Learning AGent (LAG). The current data structures only account for Simple Black and White Images, but will contain more complex models later on.

### To Do

1. ~~Confirm basic data output~~
2. ~~Updates to Expansion function broke analyzeImage continuity checks~~
3. ~~PatternAlign needs to account for different orders inside of each angleSet~~
4. ~~Adjust shape analysis to store part distance relations~~
5. ~~Look into making pattern analysis / alignments recursive~~
6. ~~Create a function that will handle the updating of the patterns (recursive?). Needs to handle weight changing.~~
7. Create a more confident way to determine "completness" of analysis in analyzeImage()
8. Look into ways to adjust model network to be more generalized and adaptable
9. Merging patterns that are different returns incorrect values. Look into this.
